## Project Description

This project demonstrates a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application using **PHP** and **MySQL**. The application features a **login system** with two user roles: **Admin** and **Regular Users**.

### Features
- **Login System**: Users can authenticate with their credentials, differentiating between Admins and Regular Users.
- **Admin Functionality**: Admins can manage all user records, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data.
- **User Functionality**: Regular Users can manage their own records, with limited access to their personal information.

### How It Works
- Users log in to access the application.
- Admins view and manage all users' data, while Regular Users can only manage their own.
- The application supports basic CRUD operations to maintain user information effectively.
